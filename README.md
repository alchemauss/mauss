> A declarative approach to a fast and efficient type-safe SDK

A collection of development tools written with TypeScript.

Ever been frustrated when starting up a new project? Feels like there's a lot to setup and prepare even before writing the actual code itself? Perhaps annoyed by having to write the same code to help you do something each time? This might be the library for you.

## Installation

```bash
npm install mauss
```

### Disclaimer

Although it's meant to be versatile, there will most likely be something that this library doesn't cover, but hopefully it can still be useful in most situations.

There's still a lot of room for improvements, so if there's something you think are essential that is missing and you feel it should be here, feel free to open an issue for it!
